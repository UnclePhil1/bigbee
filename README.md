- **On-chain Progression**: Permanent XP and honey tracking via Honeycomb
- **Loyalty System**: Verxio-powered tier system with multipliers and rewards
- **Multiplayer Racing**: Real-time competitive mode with Supabase
- **3D Graphics**: Immersive Three.js-powered game environment
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana wallet-based identity and rewards

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- **Game Engine**: Three.js for 3D graphics and physics
- **State Management**: React hooks with on-chain state persistence
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana wallet adapter
- **UI Framework**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

- **API Endpoints**: Stage completion, user progress, and rewards
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin communication

### Blockchain Integration
- **Honeycomb Protocol**: Mission system and on-chain progression
- **Verxio Protocol**: Loyalty tiers and reward multipliers
- **Solana**: Wallet connection and transaction handling

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Mission System (Honeycomb-Powered)
Each stage represents a unique mission with specific objectives:

1. **Honey Rush - Stage 1**: Collect 4 honey jars in 60 seconds
2. **Honey Rush - Stage 2**: Collect 7 honey jars in 90 seconds  
3. **Honey Rush - Stage 3**: Collect 10 honey jars in 120 seconds
4. **Timed Dash**: Reach the finish line in 45 seconds
5. **Wasp Escape**: Survive for 30 seconds while being chased
6. **Rescue Mission**: Guide 3 lost bees to the safe zone
7. **Honey Heist**: Collect honey while avoiding guard wasps

### Progression System
- **XP Rewards**: Earned for completing missions and achieving objectives
- **Honey Collection**: Primary resource that unlocks new stages
- **Loyalty Tiers**: Verxio-powered system with multipliers and bonuses
- **Achievement Tracking**: Permanent on-chain achievement history

### Loyalty Mechanics (Verxio-Powered)
- **Tier System**: Honey Bee ‚Üí Worker Bee ‚Üí Queen Bee ‚Üí Royal Bee
- **Streak Bonuses**: Daily login streaks provide XP multipliers
- **Voucher System**: Special rewards for tier upgrades and achievements
- **Multiplier Effects**: Increased rewards based on loyalty tier

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Honeycomb Protocol Integration

The game uses Honeycomb Protocol for:
- **Mission Creation**: Each stage is a Honeycomb mission with specific parameters
- **Completion Tracking**: Stage completions are recorded on-chain
- **Progression History**: Permanent record of player achievements
- **Trait Assignment**: Player traits evolve based on performance

```javascript
// Example: Creating a mission in Honeycomb
const mission = await honeycombService.createMission({
  name: "Honey Rush - Stage 1",
  description: "Collect 4 honey jars in 60 seconds",
  duration: 60,
  targetAmount: 4,
  resourceType: "honey",
  rewardXP: 50,
  rewardHoney: 100
});
```

### Verxio Loyalty System

Verxio powers the loyalty mechanics:
- **Tier Progression**: Automatic tier upgrades based on XP
- **Streak Tracking**: Daily login streaks with multipliers
- **Voucher Distribution**: Special rewards for achievements
- **Multiplier Effects**: Increased rewards for higher tiers

```javascript
// Example: Processing loyalty rewards
const rewards = await verxioLoyaltyService.processStageCompletion(
  walletAddress,
  stageId,
  honeyCollected,
  timeElapsed,
  isPerfect
);
```

### Three.js Game Engine

The 3D game environment is built with Three.js:
- **3D Graphics**: Immersive bee-themed world
- **Physics Engine**: Realistic movement and collision detection
- **Animation System**: Smooth character and object animations
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering for web browsers

### Multiplayer System

Real-time multiplayer using Supabase:
- **Session Management**: Create and join racing sessions
- **Real-time Updates**: Live position and score tracking
- **Leaderboards**: Competitive rankings and achievements
- **Cross-platform**: Works across different devices and browsers
